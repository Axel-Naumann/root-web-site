title: ROOTBinder Checklist
---

ROOTBinder is hosted in this [github repository](https://github.com/cernphsft/rootbinder).
In order to upgrade the container which is launched in
[Binder](http://mybinder.org/), the steps to be taken are the following:

### What if something goes wrong

It is possible that something goes wrong and the link to the interactive demo
has to be interrupted. In this case the file https://root.cern.ch/notebooks/rootbinder.html
has to be modified so to redirect to a page which clarifies the current status of the demo,
for example: https://root.cern.ch/rootbinder-unreachable .

### Preparation of the ROOT tarball

  - Clone the repository locally and enter the rootbinder directory.
  - Build the container from the dockerfile: docker build .
  - Start the docker container: docker run -t -i NAMEOFTHEIMAGE
    - The list of images is available with the command docker images
  - Build the desired version of ROOT calling the build directory "root"
  - Make a compressed tarball of root and copy it to https://root.cern.ch/notebooks/rootbinderdata

### Test and preparation of the image in Binder

  - Fork the rootbinder repository in your private set
  - Build the docker image via the Binder web interface
  - Check the notebooks are correctly working
  - Repeat the procedure with the main repository
