The following people have been working on ROOT for some time in their career and
ROOT would not be what it is without their contributions:

### Andrei Gheata

Andrei works since 2001 in the offline group of the ALICE experiment. He is an
experimental nuclear physicist who worked before ALICE on data analysis for
heavy-ion experiments in emulsions. In 2000 he started collaborating with the
ROOT project and implemented the TreeViewer interface. Andrei is the main developer
of the ROOT geometry package. He integrated the geometry in the Virtual Monte Carlo
framework by developing interfaces for the GEANT3, GEANT4 and FLUKA particle
transport engines.

### Anna Kreshuk

Anna was a project associate and contributed to different parts of ROOT, most
notably to the fitting machinery, the interface to FFTW, numerous math-related
functions, TEntryList container and PROOF GUI.

### David Gonzalez Maline

David has been working on improving the performance and correctness of various
mathematical algorithms as well as on integrating AI methods for data analysis
inside the framework. He has also worked on extending and improving the FitPanel
interface.

### Diego Marcos Segura

Diego worked as technical student on CINT dictionary optimizations.

### Eddy Offermann

Eddy joined the ROOT team during a sabbatical to work on making the ROOT matrix
package the fastest and most versatile in the industry.

### Ilka Antcheva

Ilka has been working from 2002 to 2008 in the ROOT team. She was responsible
for the GUI system and designed many high level user interfaces and widgets,
like found in many modern graphics applications: ROOT graphics editor (GED) and
various object editors, Fit Panel, Style manager, a tool for automatic C++ code
generation of any widget and the capability for widgets to save themselves. In
addition Ilka took care of the ROOT Users Guide and contributed the chapter
‘Writing a Graphical User Interface’.

### Gerardo Ganis

Gerri was a team member for more than ten years; among many other contributions
he was in charge of PROOF for many years.

### Jan Iwaszkiewicz

Jan was working in the context of a Ph.D. on scheduling and load-balancing of
distributed processing in the Parallel ROOT Facility (PROOF).

### Leandro Franco

Leo worked a Marie-Curie fellow in the ROOT team from 2005-2008\. He worked on
a number of widely different topics, from parallel sockets, I/O read-ahead,
CINT dictionary, etc.

### Maarten Ballintijn

Maarten's initial dab into ROOT was porting it to Linux in 1995\. Later he
worked on the PROOF system, bringing into production for the RHIC experiments
in Brookhaven.

### Marek Biskup

Marek worked as technical student on various aspects of PROOF, notably integrating
the TChain::Draw() command into PROOF.

### Masaharu Goto

Masa is the father of CINT. Without the indefatigable support by Masa we would
never have succeeded with the tight integration of CINT in ROOT. Masa is now
managing a large division in Agilent and cannot spend as much time on CINT as
he would like.

### Matevž Tadel

Matevž Tadel is the main developer of 3D graphics and event-visualization packages.
He holds a Ph.D. in experimental high-energy physics, obtained in 2001 for his
work on electron reconstruction in the ATLAS experiment. Before joining the ROOT
team in 2005, he worked on Gled - an advanced ROOT-based system for distributed
computing and dynamic visualisation.

### Nenad Buncic

Nenad was one of the first people joining the initial ROOT team in 1996\. He
developed the first version of the HTML documentation system (THtml) and worked
on the first version of the 3D graphics system. Nenad left in 1997.

### Paul Russo

Paul joined the ROOT team at Fermilab in 2005 and has been focusing on support
and developing CINT.

### Pere Mato

Pere Mato was the project leader from 2014 to 2017. He was the driving force
behind ROOT's migration to CMake and has contributed to PyROOT.

### Richard Maunder

Richard worked as project associate on the 3D graphics OpenGL based system.

### Susan Panacek

Susan wrote the first ROOT User's Guide and developed a number of ROOT tutorials.

### Timur Pocheptsov

Timur worked as a project associate on many different aspects of ROOT, but mostly
on the OpenGL accelerated 3D graphics and the native macOS Cocoa based GUI.
Timur also ported ROOT to the iPad. He continues to maintain the OpenGL and
Cocoa code till this day.

### Valeri Fine

Valeri was a member of the ROOT team from 1998-2000\. He made the initial port to
Windows. Currently he is the maintainer of the ROOT-Qt interface.

### Valeri Onuchin

Valeri worked as a project associate on many different aspects of ROOT, but
mostly in the GUI and graphics area. He did develop the signal/slot functionality
and the GUI builder. He also developed the Carrot ROOT enabled web server.
