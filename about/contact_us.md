You can contact the ROOT developers in the following ways, in order of preference:

  - Via the [RootTalk](https://root-forum.cern.ch) web forum. Use this forum to post
    your questions. ROOT team members are actively reading this forum and answering the
    questions. And if the developers don't happen to be online your question might be
    answered by a fellow user. Remember, before posting a question, do a search to see
    if the issue has already been discussed.
  - Via the [roottalk mailing list](mailto:roottalk@cern.ch). Check the
    [digest](roottalk-digest) to see if your question has already been discussed.
-   Direct mail to the [ROOT Developers](mailto:root-dev@cern.ch)
