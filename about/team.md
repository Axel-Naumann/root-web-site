### Axel Naumann
<img src="{{'/assets/img/AN.jpg' | relative_url}}">

Starting off as a physicist, Axel studied physics and math in Muenster, Germany.
In 2000, he got a Ph.D. position for high energy physics in Nijmegen, The Netherlands.
They sent him to Fermilab at Chicago, where he worked with the DØ experiment - which
also meant writing software from PCI drivers to data analysis code.
During that time he got involved with ROOT, converting from a user to a developer.
He contributed to whatever he needed, e.g. the statistics part, the documentation
engine, and porting it to cygwin. After a position with the Fermilab Computing
Division in 2005 he ended up at CERN in the ROOT development team. Axel is leading
the ROOT project since 2017.

### Bertrand Bellenot

Bertrand was primary working in Aluminum industry as process engineer, developing
software for data acquisition, data analysis, statistical process control (SPC)
and for X-Ray spectrometry. He has been involved in ROOT development since 2001
by porting ROOT to Windows. Bertrand is a member of the ROOT development team at
CERN since August 2005. He's currently working on GUI (Graphical User Interface),
core (mainly Windows support), and JavaScript Root (JSROOT).

### Danilo Piparo

Danilo is a particle Physicist and scientific software enthusiast. He obtained
his Ph.D at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany. He joined CERN as
member of the CMS collaboration, to then move to the SFT group in 2012. He is a
member of the ROOT team since 2013 and contributed to many of its areas: I/O,
reflection, math and statistics. He is mainly involved in the aspects of ROOT
which are relative to parallelism, performance and programming model.

### Enric Tejedor
<img src="{{'/assets/img/ET.jpg' | relative_url}}">

Enric Tejedor received his Ph.D. from the Technical University of Catalonia
(UPC, Spain) in 2013. He conducted his doctorate research as a member of the
Grid Computing and Clusters group of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, where
his researched focused on parallel programming models for distributed infrastructures
and where he participated in several EU research projects. As part of his Ph.D.,
he also carried out two internships at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center (NY, USA).
In 2015 he joined the CERN EP-SFT group as a senior fellow and later became a staff
member. He is currently working on ROOT parallelization, the ROOT Python bindings
and the SWAN service. He is also one of the administrators of the Google Summer of
Code student program (GSoC) at CERN-HEP Software Foundation.

### Guilherme Amadio

Guilherme has always been at the interface between physics and computer science.
He started his undergraduate studies in computer science at the University of
ão Paulo (USP) campus in São Carlos in 2000, but later moved to the São Paulo
campus for the course of molecular sciences, a special interdisciplinary program
of the university aimed at preparing students for scientific research. In 2004,
he moved to Japan for his master degree in nuclear physics at the University of
Tokyo, where he studied the elastic and inelastic scattering of ⁷Be+p. He then
moved on to obtain his PhD in aerospace engineering from the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA. Guilherme then worked for two years at
São Paulo State University (UNESP) in collaboration with CERN and Fermilab
before joining the ROOT Team in April of 2017. His responsibilities in ROOT
include working on the build system, performance analysis and optimization,
and support for SIMD vectorization.


### Lorenzo Moneta
<img src="{{'/assets/img/LM.jpg' | relative_url}}">

Lorenzo started working in 1989 as an experimental physicist for the ALEPH
experiment working for data analysis and software event reconstruction. He graduated
in Pisa in 1990 and he received his Ph.D. in particle physics in 1994 at the
University of Florence. Afterwards, since 1997, he was working for data analysis
of the CDF experiments and online software for the ATLAS experiment. In 2002 he
joined the physics application software group of CERN, and since 2005 he joined
the ROOT team with the responsibility of the Math work package, which provides
development and support for the ROOT mathematical and statistical libraries.

### Olivier Couet
<img src="{{'/assets/img/OC.png' | relative_url}}">

Olivier Couet received a Physic's Master from the  Strasbourg University and a
Master’s Degree in Engineering from the "Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Physique de
Strasbourg" (ENSPS) on work in computer graphics and image processing in 1985. He
then performed his Ph.D work (in Computer Graphics) at the "Laboratoire D'Annecy
le Vieux de Physique des Particules" (LAPP) on the PAW project. He has been
employed by CERN since 1988. He was one of the main authors of the PAW system,
more precisely its graphical components (HIGZ and HPLOT). HIGZ has been the
standard graphics package in High Energy Physics for years and is still being
used. He was responsible for the PAW system from 1995 until he joined the ROOT
team in 2002 and took responsibility of the graphics work package.

### Philippe Canal
<img src="{{'/assets/img/PC.jpg' | relative_url}}">

Philippe Canal has been working in the FNAL Computing Division since 1995.
Philippe graduated from Ecole Centrale Paris and has a Master in Computer Science
from Northwestern University. Philippe is responsible for the development of the
I/O sub-system and the Tree query mechanism and oversee the overall architecture
of ROOT.  Philippe coordinates the support for ROOT for all FNAL experiments.

### Vassil Vassilev
<img src="{{'/assets/img/VV.jpg' | relative_url}}">

Vassil graduated from the University of Plovdiv "Paisii Hilendarski", Bulgaria.
He received a MSc in Software Technologies and a PhD in Computer Science with
specialization in programming languages and visual programming. He joined the
ROOT team in 2010, authoring Cling - the interactive, LLVM-based C++ interpreter.
He was one of the core engineers involved in ROOT6.
Vassil is responsible for the implementation and adoption of clang's C++ modules
(PCMs) in ROOT. He also helps with interpreter and reflection related activities
in the ROOT project. He works on the CMS interests in the ROOT collaboration
including development, trouble shooting, and any other activities as may be required.
From January, 2017, Vassil is employed by Princeton University and part of the
Princeton Intel Parallel Computing Center (IPCC) project, which focuses on code
modernization in ROOT.
