The [CERN Summer Student](https://home.cern/summer-student-programme)
program is in full swing and ROOT is part of it. Today,
the second instance of the
[ROOT Summer Students' Course](https://hr-dep.web.cern.ch/content/root) takes place. A great
success: already 120 students attended the course and a another instance has
still to take place. Many exciting innovations were put in place in
[the program](https://github.com/root-project/training),
including the usage of a
[micro CernVM](https://cernvm.cern.ch) virtual machine and the CERN jupyter
notebooks' service, [SWAN](http://swan.web.cern.ch).
