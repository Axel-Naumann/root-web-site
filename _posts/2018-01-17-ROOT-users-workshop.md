The ROOT team would like to invite you to the [11th ROOT Users' Workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/697389/).

This time we meet in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina - a buzzing
melting pot of cultures since centuries. The workshop features four days of
presentations and discussions on everything ROOT: what works for you, what doesn't
and how ROOT evolves to address future challenges. ROOT is changing; this is your
chance to influence what happens and to interact with all its developers! Our way
of saying "thank you for participating" is to make sure that you have a great time
in a unique location!

The topics will cover:
  - ROOT roadmap
  - TDataFrame, a modern TTree::Draw()
  - On the way to ROOT 7: graphics, histograms, trees
  - New persistency features
  - Concurrency and ROOT
  - ROOT in Javascript
  - Machine learning in and with ROOT
  - Math tools and techniques
  - User feedback

Please [mark your calendars](https://indico.cern.ch/export/event/697389.ics) and
start to think which abstracts to submit. Registration and abstract submission will open soon.
